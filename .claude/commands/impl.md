# impl

Implementation Workflow - Execute GitHub issue implementation based on current mode.

## Usage

```
/impl [issue-number] [optional message]
```

## Examples

```bash
/impl 123                    # Implement issue #123
/impl 123 with extra context # Implement with additional context
/impl 456                    # Implement issue #456
```

## Implementation

### Pre-Implementation Validation

1. **Check Dependencies**:
   - Validate GitHub CLI (`gh`) availability
   - Verify Git tools are available

2. **Validate Issue**:
   - Check issue exists and is open
   - Verify issue has `task` label
   - Extract issue title and metadata

3. **Validate Environment**:
   - Ensure clean git working directory
   - Verify we're in a git repository
   - **CRITICAL**: Verify we are NOT on main branch - abort if on main

### Implementation Steps

1. **FORCE Staging Branch Checkout**:
   ```bash
   # HARD ENFORCE: staging ONLY - never checkout main
   git fetch origin staging --update-head-ok
   git checkout -B staging origin/staging --force
   git pull origin staging

   # VERIFY we are on staging branch
   if [ "$(git branch --show-current)" != "staging" ]; then
     echo "ERROR: Failed to switch to staging branch. Current branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
     exit 1
   fi
   echo "✅ CONFIRMED: Now on staging branch"
   ```

2. **Create Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/task-[issue-number]-[description]
   ```
   - Extract description from issue title
   - Use naming convention: `feature/task-{issue}-{description}`

3. **Step 0: Write Tests First (Red Phase)** ⚠️ MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   # Create test files BEFORE implementing code
   # Tests should fail initially (Red phase)
   cargo test
   # Expected: Tests fail (no implementation yet)
   ```
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for the new functionality
   - Write integration tests for API endpoints or service integrations
   - Tests document the expected behavior before code exists
   - This ensures Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow

4. **Mode-Specific Execution**:

   **MANUAL Mode**:
   - Agent (Claude) implements directly using code editing tools
   - Execute all implementation steps automatically
   - Handle all validation requirements
   - Create commit with proper format
   - Push branch to remote (NO PR creation)

   **COPILOT Mode**:
   - GitHub Copilot handles implementation automatically
   - Execute all validation steps
   - Create commit with proper format
   - Push branch to remote (NO PR creation)

## Validation Requirements (100% required):
   ```bash
   ✅ Test must be written BEFORE code implementation (Red Phase)
   ✅ Test coverage must be comprehensive for new/modified code
   ✅ Tests must PASS (Green Phase complete)
   cargo build --release          # Build validation
   cargo clippy -- -D warnings    # Lint validation
   cargo check                    # Type check validation
   cargo test                     # Test validation (MANDATORY)
   ```

## 🔴🟢🔵 Red-Green-Refactor Cycle (TDD)

The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is the core of Test-Driven Development:

### 🔴 Red Phase (Tests First)
- **Write failing tests** for the functionality you want to implement
- Tests document the expected behavior
- Run tests: `cargo test` → tests FAIL (because code doesn't exist yet)
- Example:
  ```rust
  // tests/question_filter_tests.rs
  #[test]
  fn test_empty_question_rejected() {
    let result = filter_question("");
    assert!(result.is_err());
  }
  
  #[test]
  fn test_valid_question_accepted() {
    let result = filter_question("What is my future?");
    assert!(result.is_ok());
  }
  ```

### 🟢 Green Phase (Minimal Implementation)
- **Write minimal code** to make the failing tests pass
- Don't implement extra features yet
- Focus only on passing the tests you wrote
- Run tests: `cargo test` → tests PASS
- Example:
  ```rust
  // src/agents/question_filter.rs
  pub fn filter_question(q: &str) -> Result<String, FilterError> {
    if q.is_empty() {
      return Err(FilterError::EmptyQuestion);
    }
    Ok(q.to_string())
  }
  ```

### 🔵 Refactor Phase (Improve Code)
- **Refactor the code** for clarity, performance, and maintainability
- Keep tests passing while improving code quality
- Run tests: `cargo test` → tests still PASS
- Run linter: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` → zero warnings
- Run formatter: `cargo fmt` → consistent style
- Example improvements:
  ```rust
  pub fn filter_question(q: &str) -> Result<String, FilterError> {
    q.trim()
      .is_empty()
      .then(|| Err(FilterError::EmptyQuestion))
      .unwrap_or_else(|| Ok(q.trim().to_string()))
  }
  ```

### Complete TDD Workflow Example
```bash
# Step 1: RED - Create failing tests
# Write test file: tests/question_filter_tests.rs
cargo test                                  # → FAILS (no implementation)

# Step 2: GREEN - Implement minimal code
# Write code: src/agents/question_filter.rs
cargo test                                  # → PASSES
cargo build --release                       # → Success

# Step 3: REFACTOR - Improve code quality
# Improve implementation while keeping tests passing
cargo clippy -- -D warnings                 # → Zero warnings
cargo fmt                                   # → Formatted
cargo test                                  # → Still PASSES

# Final validation
cargo build --release                       # ✅ 100% SUCCESS
cargo clippy -- -D warnings                 # ✅ 100% SUCCESS
cargo test                                  # ✅ 100% SUCCESS
```

## Validation Requirements (100% required):

6. **Commit Format**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: [feature description]

   - Address #[issue-number]: [task title]
   - Test-first implemented: Tests written before code implementation
   - Red-Green-Refactor cycle followed (Red → Green → Refactor)
   - Build validation: 100% PASS (cargo build --release)
   - Lint validation: 100% PASS (cargo clippy -- -D warnings)
   - Type validation: 100% PASS (cargo check)

## Mode-Specific Behavior

### MANUAL Mode

**Agent (Claude) Execution**:
- Read and analyze task requirements from GitHub issue
- Implement code changes directly using editing tools (Read/Edit/Write)
- Run all validation steps automatically (build, lint, type-check)
- Create commit with proper format and push to feature branch
- **NO PR creation** - ends with branch push

### COPILOT Mode

**GitHub Copilot Execution**:
- Trigger GitHub Copilot to handle implementation workflow
- Monitor all validation steps completion
- Ensure proper commit formatting and branch push
- **NO PR creation** - ends with branch push

## Error Handling

- **Issue not found**: Clear error with issue number
- **Invalid environment**: Git status and directory checks
- **Validation failures**: Stop workflow and report errors
- **Mode-specific**: Provide appropriate guidance per mode

## Integration

- **Before**: Use `/plan [task]` to create task issues
- **After**: Use `/pr [feedback]` to create pull request
- **Mode**: Use `/mode [manual|copilot]` to set execution mode
- **Context**: Use `/fcs [topic]` for context discussions

## Files

- Feature branches: `feature/task-{issue}-{description}`
- `.claude/current_mode` - Determines execution behavior
- GitHub Issues - Task definitions and requirements

## Notes

- **CRITICAL**: Always works from staging branch as base - NEVER from main
- **HARD ENFORCED**: Command will fail if trying to run from main branch
- Feature branch naming is strictly enforced
- 100% validation is mandatory before commits
- Mode affects who performs implementation steps
- Never merge PRs yourself - wait for team approval
